# MoCo_cGAN

MoCo_cGAN: A conditional generative adverserial network designed to predict motion free MR images from motion-corrupted data. 
This model is based off of work done by Patricia Johnson (https://github.com/pjohnson519/MoCo_cGAN):

PM Johnson, M Drangova. Conditional generative adversarial network for three-dimensional rigid-body motion correction in MRI,
Magnetic Reson Med, 2019.

This version includes options to perform motion correction using multichannel data prior to coil combination.
